This repository is part of a lecture series on compiler construction at the [Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University Karlsruhe](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/en/general/about-dhbw-karlsruhe.html) in Germany. Special to this university are the career-integrated undergraduate study programs. In alternating three-month phases, students learn theory at the university and receive practical training from an enterprise. For a listing of lecture content, see section T3INF4211 in the [university's module handbook](https://www.dhbw.de/fileadmin/user/public/SP/KA/Informatik/Informatik.pdf).

The project is kept small on purpose. It does not intend to offer as many features as possible or to be particularly powerful. Please consider this before creating a pull request.
