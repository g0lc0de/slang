This repository is part of a lecture series on compiler construction at the [Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University Karlsruhe](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/en/general/about-dhbw-karlsruhe.html) in Germany. Special to this university are the career-integrated undergraduate study programs. In alternating three-month phases, students learn theory at the university and receive practical training from an enterprise. For a listing of lecture content, see section T3INF4211 in the [university's module handbook](https://www.dhbw.de/fileadmin/user/public/SP/KA/Informatik/Informatik.pdf).

**Caution: Contrary to general conventions, various commits may contain incomplete states, causing several tests to break. These commits are preceded by an exclamation mark in the commit message. The background to this is that the students are to implement these very functions in a test-driven manner.**

## Contribute to this project

The project is kept small on purpose. It does not intend to offer as many features as possible or to be particularly powerful. Please consider this before creating a pull request. Functional enhancements are likely to be rejected. Changes, however, that serve usability, clarity, structure or better understanding are always welcome.
